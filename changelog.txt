Renamed Handlers to Activators
Removed ComponentList and replaced by IEnumerable<ComponentInfo> and extension methods
Changed default ShouldAutoRegister to false
Changed responsability of ConstructorResolvers to only resolve which constructor to use and left parameters values determination to DefaultActivator
Changed auto registering stuff by implementations of IAutoRegisterConvention (it become less discoverable, but I also think that this is not an advisable approach)
